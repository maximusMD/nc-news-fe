# ADVANCED: User Experience
## Description
Now is a good time to look at improving the user experience of your site.

Consider the following, refactoring your code as needed:

Are users aware of when data is loading?
Is your navigation intuitive? Users shouldn't have to work hard to find what they need.
Can your users easily see if they are logged in or not?
Have you given a way for users to undo certain actions, e.g. undoing an accidental upvote?
Have you given feedback to users when an error occurs?
