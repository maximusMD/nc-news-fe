# ADVANCED: Responsiveness
## Description
Now that you have the functionality in place, you should also make sure that your app is responsive.

Consider the following, and refactor your code as necessary:

Have you adopted a mobile-first design?
Is your app nicely viewable on a variety of screen sizes?
Are the images on your pages responsive to different screen sizes?
Have you made use of relative measurements where needed?
Could you add media queries to improve responsiveness?
Should the layout be the same or different on different screen sizes?
