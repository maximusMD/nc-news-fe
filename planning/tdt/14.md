# CORE: Write a README
## Description
Nearly there! Now you just need to add a README to your project.

Make sure that your README includes the following:

A link to the deployed version.
General info about your app, a brief description of what the project is, and how to use your app.
A link to your back end repo.
The minimum version of Node required to run locally. You can check your Node version using node --version in your terminal.
Clear instructions on how to run your project locally, e.g. git clone <repo-url>, cd..., etc.
