# ADVANCED: General Styling
## Description
Now is a good time to look at improving the styling of your app.

Consider the following:

Are you using too many colours on one page? Just two or three is enough.
Have you used a contrast checker to see if your text is legible against your background?
Have you given enough padding and margin for elements on your page?
Could you make use of both classes and ids for specific styling?
Have you challenged yourself to use tools like flex and grid?
